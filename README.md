# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Model — DecisionTreeRegressor

A machine learning model using **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict car prices based on vehicle features like brand, model, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic detection of numeric and categorical features  
- ⚙️ **ML Pipeline**: Clean integration of preprocessing and modeling using `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`  
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Regressor**: Easy-to-interpret, non-linear regression model  
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (R²)  
- 💡 **Scalable Code**: Easily replace the model or expand with new features

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset includes various car-related features such as:

- `make`, `model`, `year`
- `fuel_type`, `transmission`
- `mileage`, `engine_size`
- `price` (target variable)
